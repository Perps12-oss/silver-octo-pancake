| `cerebro/v2/ui/toolbar.py` | ✅ Complete | 340 | Top toolbar with Add/Remove/Start/Stop/Settings/Help buttons |
| `cerebro/v2/ui/mode_tabs.py` | ✅ Complete | 170 | CTkSegmentedButton for 6 scan modes |
| `cerebro/v2/ui/folder_panel.py` | ✅ Complete | 650+ | Left panel: scan folders, protect folders, mode-specific options |
| `cerebro/v2/ui/results_panel.py` | ✅ Complete | 620+ | Center panel with CheckTreeview (grouped results, sortable columns) |
| `cerebro/v2/ui/preview_panel.py` | ✅ Complete | 570+ | Bottom panel with dual ZoomCanvas for side-by-side comparison |

## Phase 2 — File Dedup Engine (Wire-Up) ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** See `PHASE_2_PROGRESS.md` for detailed implementation.

**Summary:**
- ✅ Wire toolbar Start/Stop to orchestrator
- ✅ Wire progress callback to status bar
- ✅ Wire results to CheckTreeview
- ✅ Wire result selection to preview
- ✅ Wire "Delete Selected" to send2trash
- ✅ Wire results sub-filter tabs (via results_panel)

**Files Modified:**
- `cerebro/v2/ui/main_window.py` - Added ~250 lines of integration code

---

**Goal:** Connect Phase 0 file dedup engine to Phase 1 shell. First fully functional scan mode.

### Tasks Remaining

1. **Wire toolbar "Start Search" to orchestrator**
   - Disable Start button, enable Stop button
   - Call `orchestrator.start_scan()` with folders from left panel
   - Progress callback updates status bar via `after()`

2. **Wire progress callback to status bar**
   - Update `ScanProgress` data: files_scanned, duplicates_found, groups_found, bytes_reclaimable, elapsed_seconds
   - Status bar updates every 200ms
   - Show current_file path (truncated)

3. **Wire results to CheckTreeview**
   - On scan complete, call `orchestrator.get_results()`
   - Populate treeview: group headers as parent rows, files as child rows
   - Apply auto-mark rule (keep largest) for checkbox states
   - Emit `<<ScanComplete>>` event

4. **Wire result selection to preview**
   - Click file → load into preview canvas A
   - Click second file in same group → load into canvas B (side-by-side)
   - Non-image files show metadata-only preview

5. **Wire "Delete Selected" to send2trash**
   - Collect all checked items
   - Show confirmation dialog with file count and space to reclaim
   - On confirm: `send2trash.send2trash(path)` for each
   - Remove from treeview, update status bar counters

6. **Wire results sub-filter tabs**
   - "All | Images | Videos | Docs | Audio | Other" tabs filter visible results
   - This is a view filter on in-memory results (no re-scan)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full scan of 10K files completes in < 15 seconds (SSD)
- [ ] Re-scan with no changes completes in < 2 seconds (cache hit)
- [ ] Results display grouped correctly with accurate sizes and dates
- [ ] Deleting checked files sends to Recycle Bin successfully
- [ ] Progress bar and status counters update smoothly during scan

## Phase 3-6 — Future Work (Not Started)

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 3 | Image Dedup Engine + Preview Panel enhancements | ❌ Not Started |
| Phase 4 | Video & Music Dedup Engines | ❌ Not Started |
| Phase 5 | Empty Folders + Large Files utilities | ❌ Not Started |
| Phase 6 | Selection Assistant (8+ rules) + Premium Polish | ❌ Not Started |

## Key Integration Points Needed

### main_window.py Updates Required
1. Replace placeholder frames with actual panel components:
   - `FolderPanel` in `_left_panel_frame`
   - `ResultsPanel` in `_center_panel_frame`
   - `PreviewPanel` in `_preview_frame`

2. Implement `ScanOrchestrator` integration:
   - Add `self._orchestrator = ScanOrchestrator()`
   - Wire toolbar buttons to orchestrator methods
   - Wire progress callback to status bar

3. Connect panel events:
   - Folder panel → orchestrator folders
   - Results panel selection → preview panel
   - Selection bar → results panel checkboxes
   - Delete button → send2trash flow

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
pip install send2trash windnd
```

## Summary

- **Phase 0:** ✅ Complete (6 files, ~2,000 lines)
- **Phase 1:** ✅ Complete (11 files, ~4,900 lines)
- **Phase 2:** 🔄 Next (integration work only, no new files)
- **Total Progress:** ~35% complete by file count, ~50% by architecture

The foundation is solid. Phase 2 is about wiring existing components together to make the first functional scan mode work.
