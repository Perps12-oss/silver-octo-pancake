"""
Shared group-level invariant checks for all active scan paths.

Extracted from cerebro/core/scanners/turbo_scanner.py at Phase 2d
(fix: 434fa7f ported to all paths) so that Paths A, B, C, and D
can all import the same guard without duplicating logic.

Strict mode:
    CEREBRO_STRICT=1   — guard raises AssertionError (tests, CI, dev runs)
    unset / empty      — guard logs warning and drops offending entry (default
                         production posture; no -O flag is used in any Cerebro
                         launch path, so the built-in debug flag is always True —
                         env-var gating is the correct mechanism here)

    Phase 2a (dedupe_roots) fixes the root-overlap variant of Bug 1. This
    guard is defense-in-depth — catches any future regression where two paths
    resolve to the same inode through a mechanism dedupe_roots does not cover
    (hardlinks, junctions, symlinks, cross-drive aliases).

    Accepts heterogeneous group formats:

      - List of Path objects          — file_dedup_engine (Path D)

    Each item is returned as-is in the kept list; only the path is extracted
    for canonicalization.

    Strict mode (CEREBRO_STRICT=1): raises AssertionError with context.
    Default (unset): logs warning and drops the offending entry.
