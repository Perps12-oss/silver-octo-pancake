"""
Shared group-level invariant checks for all active scan paths.

Extracted from cerebro/core/scanners/turbo_scanner.py at Phase 2d
(fix: 434fa7f ported to all paths) so that Paths A, B, C, and D
can all import the same guard without duplicating logic.

Strict mode:
    CEREBRO_STRICT=1   — guard raises AssertionError (tests, CI, dev runs)
    unset / empty      — guard logs warning and drops offending entry (default
                         production posture). ``CEREBRO_STRICT`` is evaluated on
                         each call so tests and shells can toggle without restart.

    Accepts heterogeneous group formats:
